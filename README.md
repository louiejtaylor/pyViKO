A Python tool to generate viral knockouts.

###What is Pyviko?
Pyviko stands for Python Viral Knockouts (stylized: pyViKO). Pyviko is a tool for designing molecular cloning protocols in complex viruses or other organisms with overlapping genes.

###What is an “overprinted gene”?
An overprinted gene is defined as the extension of one gene's open reading frame into the reading frame of a second gene. A single DNA sequence can code for multiple proteins in different reading frames or by reading in different directions. For more information, see the [Wikipedia article on reading frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_frame) or this (open access) [paper on origins of overprinted genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22821011).
